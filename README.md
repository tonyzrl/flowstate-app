FlowState — A Smart Wellbeing & Study Companion App

A Learning Futures Challenge Project by Group 19

🌟 Overview

FlowState is a wellbeing–driven study companion app designed to support university students in balancing academic workload, work commitments, personal wellbeing, and social life. The app leverages smart tracking, AI assistance, behavioural data, and immersive technologies to improve both student wellbeing and academic performance.

The project was developed as part of the 2025 Curtin Learning Futures Challenge, addressing the rising levels of stress, burnout, and disengagement experienced by students, as well as the lack of visibility educators have into student wellbeing trends.

🎯 Problem Statement

University students increasingly struggle to manage study, work, personal responsibilities, and mental health simultaneously. This imbalance often leads to burnout, missed deadlines, academic decline, and emotional distress. Educators also face limited insight into how their students are coping, making timely support difficult.

FlowState tackles this issue by creating an integrated ecosystem of wellbeing tracking, study optimisation tools, and AI-driven feedback loops for students and educators.

Real-time mood and wellbeing tracking

AI-powered study and mental health assistance

Smart scheduling and alternative study pathways

VR-based mindfulness experiences

Wearable integration for stress detection

Intelligent educator dashboards to identify at-risk students early
