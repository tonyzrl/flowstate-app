# FlowState — A Smart Wellbeing & Study Companion App 🌟
*A Learning Futures Challenge Project by Group 19*

A demo of the app is hosted at: https://flowstate-app.netlify.app/

## Overview
FlowState is a wellbeing–driven study companion app designed to support university students in balancing academic workload, personal responsibilities and mental wellbeing. By combining smart tracking, behavioural data, AI support and immersive technologies, FlowState aims to improve both student wellbeing and academic performance.

This project was developed for the **2025 Curtin Learning Futures Challenge**, addressing rising student stress levels and the lack of visibility educators have into student wellbeing.

---

## Problem Statement
University students increasingly struggle to manage study, work, personal responsibilities and mental health. This imbalance often leads to burnout, falling behind, emotional distress, and missed deadlines. Educators also lack insight into how their students are coping.

FlowState addresses these issues by creating an integrated ecosystem that supports students and empowers educators through meaningful insight.

## Core Solution
FlowState is a personalised wellbeing companion app built around three principles:

- **Wellbeing** — detect stress early, regulate emotions, and support mental health.
- **Productivity** — optimise study habits, scheduling and focus.
- **Connection** — build communication channels between students, peers and educators.
